# CS132_Project_Elevator
The course project of CS132 Software Engineer. We were divided into groups of three with each one assigned a topic. Mine is an elevator APP on Matlab. 

Matlab is really a simple beginning for software engineers. To my credit, the course is far more than only the coding but also lots of theory and developing standards. I got full score in midterm exam and the presentation was acclaimed :)

The directory:

- `Code`: 
  - The matlab code with `Deployment` and simple `Testcases`.

- `Documents`: 
  - We are required to finish lots of documents like weekly meeting reports and manuals for both customers and developers.
  - The `xml`  and `UPPAAL` graphs are included

- `Models`:
  - The `xml` model for my elevator design.
